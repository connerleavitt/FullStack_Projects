# FullStack_Projects
This Repo will house collaborative full stack data science projects. 

This repository will be a place in which I will collaberate with other analysts and data scientist to build something completely from scratch and launch it into the real world. Hence the name FullStack_Projects. 

The main themes of this reposity are going to be collaberation (team work makes the dream work), creating/obtaining the data, analzying and modeling the data, and then building an application or launching the project on live data in the real world.
